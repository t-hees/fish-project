* Running
** Local variables
Local variables are used for docker-compose and for the database configuration
in spring.
Defining them in a .env file in the root directory allows docker-compose to
pick them up automatically.
If not using docker, one must ensure that these variables are defined before
starting the backend by configuring IDE run options or exporting them in
the shell.

*** Required environment variables with placeholder values:
#+begin_src sh
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DBNAME=springdb
DB_USERNAME=maria
DB_PASSWORD=mariapass
SPRING_PORT=8080
#+end_src

*** Additionally required variable for docker-compose with a placeholder value:
#+begin_src sh
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass
#+end_src
